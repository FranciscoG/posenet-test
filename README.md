Messing around with the Posenet model for tensoflow-js

[Posenet](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/posenet)

This repo is not using Babel so only use very modern browser.

To begin the Webpack dev server and file watcher
```
npm start
```


Code originally comes from [Google's camera demo](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/posenet/demos).
